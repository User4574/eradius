h1. eradius

h2. What?

p. eradius (pronounced "irradius" like irradiate) is a fledgling RFC2865 authentication server that I wrote in Erlang.

h2. Why?

p. Why do you think? I was bored.

h2. Status

p. It currently only authenticates users against a local DB.

p. On the other hand it should be stupidly performant, because the config gets compiled in to the bytecode at consult-time, and it is built to make good use of SMP. I need to benchmark this.

p. But also the code is AWFUL at the moment.

h2. How?

bc. $ erl
1> c(er_packet).
2> c(er_tlv).
3> c(er_auth).
4> c(eradius).
5> eradius:start().
6> eradius:stop().

h1. eradius

h2. What?

p. eradius (pronounced "irradius" like irradiate) is a fledgling RFC2865 authentication server that I wrote in Erlang.

h2. Why?

p. I was bored.

h2. Status

p. It currently only authenticates users against a local DB, but the flexibility should be in to start adding auth modules.

p. It currently doesn't do authorisation or accounting.

p. On the other hand it should be stupidly performant, because the config gets compiled in to the bytecode at consult-time, and it is built to make good use of SMP. I need to benchmark this.

p. But also the code is -AWFUL at the moment- getting better.

h2. How?

bc. $ make run
% do auths
1> eradius:stop().
2> q().

h1. eradius

h2. What?

p. eradius (pronounced "irradius" like irradiate) is a garbage RFC2865 authentication server that I wrote in Erlang.

h2. Why?

p. I was bored.

h2. Status

p. It has a very modular authentication/authorisation system, where an incoming request gets passed through a series of AAA steps which each add facts into the session. At the end, an action is taken based on one of several built-in facts.

p. It currently doesn't do accounting, or CoAs, or really anything useful.

p. On the other hand it should be stupidly performant, because the config gets compiled in to the bytecode at consult-time, and it is built to make use of SMP. I have not benchmarked this.

p. Since the config is compiled in, you have to rebuild eradius every time you change something, but that doesn't take long. It might if you start adding complex AAA steps.

p. Also the code is -AWFUL at the moment- getting better.

h2. Running

p. Configure the daemon in config.hrl.

bc. $ make run
% do auths
1> eradius:stop().
2> q().
